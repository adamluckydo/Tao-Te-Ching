Tao Te Ching
Edited for punctuation following the image/energy rules


Verse 1
The way that becomes a way
is not the Immortal Way.
The name that becomes a name
is not the Immortal Name.

The nameless is the beginning of Heaven and Earth.
The named is the mother of the ten thousand things.

Desireless, one sees the mystery.
Desiring, one sees the manifestations.

Two different names
for the same source.

The one we call Dark
The Dark beyond Dark
The door to all beginnings.


Verse 2
If that becomes beautiful
this becomes ugly.
If that becomes good
this becomes evil.

Having produces not having
Hard creates easy
Long defines short
High requires low
Note contrasts noise
After follows before.

Thus the sage acts without effort
and teaches without words.

The ten thousand things arise endlessly.
He doesn't start the things he begins.
He doesn't presume when he acts.
He doesn't claim what he achieves.
And because he makes no claim
he suffers no loss.


Verse 3
Bestowing no honors
keeps people from fighting.
Prizing no treasures
keeps people from stealing.
Displaying no temptation
keeps people from acting up.

The sage rules by emptying the mind and filling the stomach
Weakening the will and strengthening the bones.

By keeping the people from knowing or wanting
and keeping the people who know from acting
he thus rules them all.


Verse 4
The Tao is empty.
Used, but never exhausted.
Bottomless, like the ancestor of us all.

Dulling our edges
Untying our knots
Softening our light
Joining our dust.

So deep, yet ever present.
I wonder whose child it is.
It is older than God.


Verse 5
Heaven and Earth are impartial,
treating the ten thousand things like straw dogs.
Impartial is the sage,
treating people like straw dogs.

Between Heaven and Earth
is a space like a bellows.
Empty yet inexhaustible,
each movement produces more.
Talking only wastes it.
Keep it inside.


Verse 6
The Valley Spirit that doesn't die
we call the Dark Womb.
The Dark Womb's mouth
we call the source of creation.

It is like a veil, barely seen.
And yet we can't exhaust it.


Verse 7
Heaven is eternal and Earth is immortal.
The reason they're eternal and immortal
is because they don't live for themselves.
Hence they can live forever.

The sage stays back
but ends up in front.
He lets himself go
but ends up safely held.
Selflessness must be the reason
that whatever he seeks he finds.


Verse 8
The best are like water.
Nurturing the ten thousand things without trying to
Flowing in places that others avoid
And so they are like the Tao.

Dwelling with earth
Cultivating with depth
Relating with kindness
Speaking with truth
Ruling with peace
Working with skill
Acting with awareness.

And because they don't contend
they are free of blame.


Verse 9
Instead of pouring in more,
better to stop short.
Sharpen the blade
and it won't last long.
Houses full of treasure
can never be safe.
The vanity of success
invites its own failure.

Retire when your work is done.
That is the Way of Heaven.


Verse 10
Can you hold fast your crescent soul and not let it wander?

Can you make your breath as soft as a baby's?

Can you wipe your Dark Mirror free of dust?

Can you serve and rule without effort?

Can you become the female,
opening and closing Heaven's Gate?

Can you open to everything,
understanding without knowing?

Give birth and nurture.
Create without possessing.
Act without expecting.
Rule without controlling.
This is called Dark Virtue.


Verse 11
Thirty spokes converge at the hub,
but it's the center hole that makes the wheel turn.

Clay is shaped to make a pot,
but it's the space inside that makes it useful.

Windows and doors are carved for a room,
but it's the holes that make a house livable.

Existence makes it possible,
but nonexistence makes it work.


Verse 12
The five colors blind the eye.
The five tones deafen the ear.
The five flavors numb the tongue.
Riding and hunting disturb the mind.
Precious things lead us to wrongdoing.

Thus the sage puts the stomach ahead of the eyes.
Thus he picks this over that.


Verse 13
Favor and disgrace are like warnings.
Honor and disaster are like the body.

Why are favor and disgrace like warnings?
To seek favor is to stand beneath.
To gain it is like a warning.
To lose it is like a warning.
Thus are favor and disgrace like warnings.

Why are honor and disaster like the body?
The reason we have disaster
is because we have a body.
If we didn't have a body
we wouldn't have disaster.

One who loves himself without seeking favor
can be entrusted with the world.
One who loves his body without fearing disaster
can truly care for the world.


Verse 14
We look but don't see it
and call it invisible.
We listen but don't hear it
and call it inaudible.
We reach but don't grasp it
and call it intangible.
Three failed means to knowledge
I weave into one.

Not lit from above,
casting no shade below.
Too fine to be named,
it returns to nothing.
This is the formless form,
the immaterial image.
It is indefinable.

Meeting it, you cannot see its face.
Following it, you cannot see its back.
Hold to the ancient Way
to rule this very realm
and discover what has always been true.

This is the essence of the Tao.


Verse 15
The ancient masters sought the unfathomable
and penetrated the dark.
Because they cannot be known,
I describe them with reluctance.

They were careful as if crossing a river in winter
Cautious as if danger were nearby
Reserved like a visiting guest
Yielding like melting ice
Simple like uncarved wood
Open like a valley
Murky like a puddle.

But a puddle becomes clear when it's still.
And out of stillness, life is roused.

Those who treasure this Way
don't seek fulfillment.
Not seeking fulfillment,
they reside in the dark.


Verse 16
Let everything be empty,
and the center be still.
The ten thousand things rise and fall,
and we watch them return.
They grow and flourish,
returning to the source.

Returning to the source is stillness.
To be still is to revive.
To revive is to endure.

Knowing this cycle is wisdom.
Not knowing is to suffer in vain.

Knowing how to endure is to be all-embracing.
All-embracing means impartial.
Impartiality leads to nobility.
Nobility leads to Heaven.
Heaven leads to the Tao.

Being at one with the Tao means long life.
Life without trouble.


Verse 17
The greatest rulers are barely known.
The next best are loved and revered.
Then come those who are feared and respected.
And finally, those who are despised.

One who does not trust others
will not be trusted.

Hesitate and guard your words.
When their work succeeds,
people will think they did it.


Verse 18
When the great Tao is forgotten,
goodness and justice appear.
When reason appears,
the great pretense begins.

When kinship falls into discord,
filial piety and devotion arise.
When the country is in chaos,
loyal officials appear.


Verse 19
Get rid of holiness and wisdom
and people will live a hundred times better.
Get rid of kindness and justice
and people recover piety and devotion.
Get rid of cleverness and profit
and thieves will cease to exist.

But these three sayings are not enough.
Hence let this be added:
Wear the undyed and hold the uncarved.
Abolish self-interest and cast off desire.
Get rid of learning and problems will vanish.


Verse 20
Yes and no
aren't so far apart.
Beautiful and ugly
aren't so unalike.
What others fear
we too must fear.
What nonsense!

People joyfully feast
as if they were at the Great Sacrifice,
or climbing a tower
to look from a terrace in spring.

I sit here and make no sign,
like a baby that doesn't smile,
lost with no one to turn to.

Others have plenty,
I alone have nothing.
My mind is so foolish,
so simple.
Others are clear and bright,
I alone am dim.
Others are sharp and clever,
I alone am confused.

I drift like the waves of the sea,
blowing aimlessly like the wind.

Everyone has a purpose.
I alone am directionless and dumb.
For I alone choose to differ.
I drink from the Great Mother's breast.


Verse 21
The expression of deepest virtue
comes from the Tao alone.

The Tao in action
waxes and wanes.
It waxes and wanes
but inside is an image.
It wanes and waxes
but inside is a form.
It's deep and dark
but inside is an essence.
An essence that is true and real
and inside that lies faith.

From the very beginning until now
its name has never changed.
So we might follow our fathers.

How do we know what our fathers were like?
Through this.


Verse 22
Partial means whole.
Crooked means straight.
Hollow means full.
Worn-out means new.
Less means content.
More means confused.
Thus the sage holds onto the One
to use in guiding the world.

Not watching himself,
he appears.
Not displaying himself,
he flourishes.
Not flattering himself,
he succeeds.
Not parading himself,
he leads.
Because he doesn't compete,
no one can compete against him.

The ancients who said partial means whole
came close indeed.
Becoming whole depends on this.


Verse 23
To talk little is natural.
A gale doesn't last all morning.
A squall doesn't last all day.
Who else could make these?
Only Heaven and Earth.
If Heaven and Earth can't make things last,
what about man?

Thus in whatever you do,
let those on the Way be one with the Way.
Let those who succeed be one with success.
Let those who fail be one with failure.

Be one with success,
for the Way succeeds too.
Be one with failure,
for the Way fails too.


Verse 24
Who tiptoes doesn't stand.
Who strides doesn't walk.
Who watches himself doesn't appear.
Who displays himself doesn't flourish.
Who flatters himself doesn't succeed.
Who parades himself doesn't lead.

On the road they say:
Too much food and a tiring pace
do not bring happiness.
Therefore followers of the Tao avoid them.


Verse 25
Something featureless yet complete,
born before Heaven and Earth.
Silent and formless,
it stands alone and unchanging.
Not knowing its name
I call it the Tao.
Forced to name it
I call it great.

Great means boundless.
Boundless means ever-flowing.
Ever-flowing means ever-returning.

The Tao is great.
Heaven is great.
Earth is great.
The king is also great.
The realm consists of four greats,
and the king is one of them.

Man follows Earth.
Earth follows Heaven.
Heaven follows the Tao.
The Tao follows itself.


Verse 26
Heavy is the root of light.
Still is the master of busy.

Therefore the sage might travel all day
without leaving his heavy baggage cart.
Even when surrounded by activity
he remains still and detached.

Why would the lord of ten thousand chariots
treat himself more lightly than his kingdom?
If he treats himself lightly
he will lose touch with his root.
If he becomes too busy
he will lose his mastery.


Verse 27
Good walking leaves no tracks.
Good talking reveals no flaws.
Good accounting needs no beads.
Good doors need no locks,
yet can't be opened.
Good binding ties no knots,
yet can't be undone.

Thus the sage is good at saving people,
yet abandons no one,
nor anything of use.
This is called following the light.

Thus the good are teachers of the bad.
The bad are students of the good.
Not honoring their teachers,
not cherishing their students,
the wise alone are perfectly blind.
This is called peering into the mystery.


Verse 28
Know the male,
but keep to the female,
and be a river for the world.
Being a river for the world,
you will be led by ancient virtue
and be born anew.

Know the pure,
but keep to the impure,
and be an example for the world.
Being an example for the world,
you will be filled with ancient virtue
and return to boundless freedom.

Know the white,
but keep to the black,
and be a guide for the world.
Being a guide for the world,
you will keep the ancient virtue
and return to the uncarved block.

The uncarved block can be split to make tools.
The sage can work as a state official.
But a master tailor doesn't cut.


Verse 29
Trying to control the world using force?
I see this not succeeding.

The world is sacred.
It can't be controlled.
To control it is to ruin it.
To grasp it is to lose it.

Sometimes leading,
sometimes following.
Sometimes breathing hard,
sometimes breathing easily.
Sometimes strong,
sometimes weak.
Sometimes expanding,
sometimes collapsing.

Thus the sage avoids extremes,
avoids excess,
avoids extravagance.


Verse 30
In using the Tao to advise a ruler,
oppose the use of force to control.
Such methods soon rebound.

Where armies camp,
brambles grow.
Best to win and then stop.
Never take advantage of power.

Win but don't be proud.
Win but don't boast.
Win but don't be cruel.
Win when you have no choice.
This is called winning without force.

Force leads to decay.
This isn't the Tao.
What isn't the Tao ends early.


Verse 31
Weapons are not auspicious tools.
All creatures despise them.
Thus the Taoist shuns them.
In peace the ruler honors the left.
In war he honors the right.

Weapons are not auspicious tools.
They are not a ruler's tools.
Wielded only when he has no choice.
Peace and quiet serve best.
Thus he does not glorify weapons.

One who glorifies weapons
enjoys killing others.
One who enjoys killing others
achieves no worldly rule.

Thus we honor the left for joy
and the right for sorrow.
The general stands on the left.
The commander on the right.
This means war is conducted like a funeral.

When you kill another,
honor him with your tears.
When the battle is won,
treat it as a wake.


Verse 32
The Tao has never had a name.
Though simple and small,
no one can command it.

If rulers could uphold it,
the ten thousand things would come together.
Heaven and Earth would join
to bestow sweet dew
without anyone giving the order.

Once the world is divided,
the distinction gives us names.
After we have names,
we should know when to stop.
One who knows when to stop
knows no trouble.
The relationship of the world to the Tao
is like rivers flowing into the sea.


Verse 33
Understanding others is wisdom.
Understanding yourself is enlightenment.
Conquering others is forceful.
Conquering yourself is strong.
Self-contentment is wealth.
Self-control is success.
Holding your place is enduring.
Dying without perishing is living.


Verse 34
The great Tao flows everywhere,
to the left and to the right.

The ten thousand things are born from it,
but it makes no claim.
When its work succeeds,
it seeks no recognition.

It nourishes the ten thousand things
without aspiring to rule.
Shall we call it small?

The ten thousand things return to it,
but it wields no control.
Shall we call it great?

Therefore the sage never acts great.
Thus he achieves greatness.


Verse 35
Hold up the great image
and the world will come
and be beyond harm,
resting safely at peace.

Music and fine food
stop people passing by,
but words of the Tao
are bland and tasteless.

We look and don't see it.
We listen and don't hear it.
Yet when we use it
it is inexhaustible.


Verse 36
What you would shorten
you should therefore lengthen.
What you would weaken
you should therefore strengthen.
What you would topple
you should therefore raise.
What you would take
you should therefore give.
This is called hiding the light.
The weak conquers the strong.

Fish can't survive out of the deep.
A state's greatest advantage
is not meant to be shown.


Verse 37
The Tao does nothing,
but leaves nothing undone.
If a ruler could uphold it,
the ten thousand things would change on their own.

If they still desired to act,
he could make them still
with simplicity that has no name.

Stilled by nameless simplicity,
they would not desire.
Not desiring,
they would be at peace,
and the world would fix itself.


Verse 38
A man of higher virtue does not insist upon his virtue.
Thus he is virtuous.
A man of lower virtue never loses sight of his virtue.
Thus he is not virtuous.

A man of higher virtue takes no action
and has no thought of action.
A man of higher kindness takes action
but has no thought of action.
A man of higher justice takes action
and has the thought of action.
A man of higher ritual takes action
but gets no response
until he threatens and compels them.

When the Way is lost,
virtue appears.
When virtue is lost,
kindness appears.
When kindness is lost,
justice appears.
When justice is lost,
ritual appears.
Ritual marks the ending of belief
and the onset of confusion.

Divination is the flower of the Way
and the beginning of delusion.
Thus the great choose essence over appearance,
the fruit and not the flower.
Thus they pick this over that.


Verse 39
Of things that became one in the past:
Heaven became one and was clear.
Earth became one and was still.
Spirits became one and were strong.
Valleys became one and were full of life.
Kings became one and were noble.

But in the limit:
Heaven would shatter if it was always clear.
Earth would crumble if it was always still.
Spirits would break if they were always strong.
Valleys would fail if they were always full.
Kings would fall if they were always noble.

Thus the noble is based on the humble,
as the high is founded on the low.
Thus do kings refer to themselves
as orphaned, widowed, and destitute.
Isn't this the basis of humility?
Thus they count many carriages
while claiming none at all.
Not wanting to tinkle like jade,
they clatter like rocks.


Verse 40
Returning is the motion of the Tao.
Yielding is the practice of the Tao.
The ten thousand things are born of being.
Being is born from nonbeing.


Verse 41
When a great person hears of the Way,
he follows it with devotion.
When an average person hears of the Way,
he doesn't know if it's real or not.
When a foolish person hears of the Way,
he laughs out loud.
If he didn't laugh,
it wouldn't be the Way.

Therefore these sayings arose:
The brightest path seems dark.
The quickest path seems slow.
The smoothest path seems rough.
The highest virtue seems low.
The whitest white seems pitch black.
The greatest virtue seems lacking.
The staunchest virtue seems apathetic.
The truest truth seems unsure.
The perfect square has no corners.
The perfect vessel is incomplete.
The perfect sound is silent.
The perfect form is shapeless.

The Tao is hidden and has no name,
but because it's the Tao
it knows how to start and how to finish.


Verse 42
The Tao gives birth to one.
One gives birth to two.
Two gives birth to three.
Three gives birth to the ten thousand things.

The ten thousand things carry yin on their backs
and hold yang in their embrace.
Harmony is found in the breath between them.

What the world hates
is to be orphaned, widowed, and destitute,
but kings use these as their titles.
Thus some gain by losing
and others lose by gaining.

Thus what other people teach
I teach as well.
The tyrant doesn't die a natural death.
This becomes my teacher.


Verse 43
The softest thing in the world
overcomes the hardest.
What doesn't exist finds room where there is none.
Thus we know the value of non-action.

Teaching without words,
succeeding without effort—
few in the world can realize this.


Verse 44
Which matters more,
fame or health?
Which is more precious,
health or wealth?
Which is more harmful,
gain or loss?

The deeper the love,
the higher the cost.
The bigger the treasure,
the greater the loss.
He who knows contentment
suffers no disgrace.
He who knows restraint
encounters no trouble
and thus lives long.


Verse 45
Great accomplishment seems incomplete,
yet it works without fail.
The fullest thing seems empty,
yet it cannot be exhausted.

The straightest thing seems crooked.
The cleverest thing seems clumsy.
The richest thing seems poor.

Activity conquers cold.
Stillness conquers heat.
He who can be perfectly still
is able to rule the world.


Verse 46
When the Tao prevails,
swift horses are used to manure fields.
When the Tao is lost,
war horses are raised on the border.

No crime is worse than yielding to desire.
No disaster is greater than discontent.
No curse is crueler than getting what you want.
Therefore being content with what you have
is true contentment indeed.


Verse 47
Without going out the door,
one may know the whole world.
Without looking out the window,
one may know the Way of Heaven.
The farther people go,
the less they know.

Thus the sage knows without moving,
names without looking,
succeeds without trying.


Verse 48
Those who seek to learn gain every day.
Those who seek the Way lose every day.

They lose and lose
until they find nothing left to do.
Nothing to do means nothing undone.

He who rules the world isn't busy.
If someone is busy,
he can't rule the world.


Verse 49
The sage has no mind of his own.
His mind is the mind of the people.

To the good he is good.
To the bad he is good.
Thus is virtue attained.
To the true he is true.
To the false he is true.
Thus is honesty attained.

The sage is humble and withdrawn.
To the world he seems confusing.
People open their eyes and ears to him,
and he acts like a little child.


Verse 50
Appearing into life.
Disappearing into death.
Three in ten are followers of life.
Three in ten are followers of death.
And people living to live
also number three in ten
and are led to the land of death.
Why is this so?
Because they cling to life.

It's said that those who guard life well
do not avoid rhinos or tigers
and will not be injured in battle.
For rhinos have nowhere to thrust their horn,
tigers have nowhere to sink their claws,
and soldiers have nowhere to bury their blades.
Why is this so?
Because for them there is no land of death.


Verse 51
The Way begets them
and virtue keeps them.
Matter forms them
and usage completes them.
Thus the ten thousand things honor the Way and glorify virtue.
Honor of the Way and glory of virtue
are not bestowed
but are always available.

The Way begets and keeps them,
cultivates and trains them,
shelters and protects them,
nurtures and sustains them.

Create without possessing.
Act without expecting.
Rule without controlling.
This is called Dark Virtue.


Verse 52
The ten thousand things have an origin
that may be called the world's mother.
One who knows the mother
also knows the children.
One who knows the children
keeps the mother safe
and lives without trouble.

One who blocks the opening
One who closes the gate
Lives without toil.
One who unblocks the opening
One who meddles in affairs
Lives without hope.

One who sees the small has vision.
One who abides in softness has strength.
One who uses his light,
one who trusts his vision,
lives without death.
This is called following eternity.


Verse 53
If I had the slightest sense
I would follow the Great Way
and my only fear would be to go astray.
The Great Way is smooth,
but people love the scenic route.

The palaces are empty,
the fields are overgrown
and the granaries are bare.
They wear fine clothes,
they carry sharp swords,
they indulge in food and drink
and possess more than they need.
This is called robbery,
and robbery is not the Way.


Verse 54
What is firmly planted is not uprooted.
What is held tight is not ripped away.
Future generations will honor it forever.

Cultivated in the self,
virtue becomes real.
Cultivated in the family,
virtue abounds.
Cultivated in the village,
virtue grows.
Cultivated in the state,
virtue prospers.
Cultivated in the world,
virtue prevails.

Therefore view the self through the self.
View the family through the family.
View the village through the village.
View the state through the state.
View the world through the world.

How do we know what the world is like?
Through this.


Verse 55
He who embodies virtue
is like a newborn child.

Wasps and scorpions won't sting him.
Spiders and snakes won't bite him.
Birds and beasts won't claw him.

His bones are weak.
His sinews are soft.
And yet his grip is firm.
He hasn't known the union of sexes,
and yet his penis is hard.
He is so full of essence
that he cries all day without becoming hoarse.
He is in perfect harmony.

Knowing harmony is knowing eternity.
Knowing eternity is called enlightenment.

Who lengthens his life tempts luck.
Who controls his breath uses force.
Force leads to decay.
This isn't the Way.
What isn't the Way ends early.


Verse 56
Those who know don't talk.
Those who talk don't know.

Seal the opening.
Close the gate.
Dull the edge.
Untie the knot.
Soften the light.
Join the dust.
This is called Dark Virtue.

It can't be embraced.
It can't be abandoned.
It can't be helped.
It can't be harmed.
It can't be exalted.
It can't be debased.
Thus does the world honor it.


Verse 57
Use direction to rule a country.
Use indirection to fight a war.
Use inaction to rule the world.
How do I know this is so?

The greater the restrictions,
the poorer the people.
The sharper the weapons,
the darker the realm.
The smarter the scheme,
the stranger the outcome.
The finer the treasure,
the thicker the thieves.

Thus the sage declares:
I change nothing
and the people transform themselves.
I stay still
and the people align themselves.
I do nothing
and the people enrich themselves.
I want nothing
and the people simplify themselves.


Verse 58
When the government does little,
the people are honest.
When the government imposes,
the people are cunning.

Happiness is rooted in misery.
Misery lurks beneath happiness.
Who knows where they end?

There is no direction.
Direction turns into indirection.
Goodness becomes evil.
The people have been deluded
for a long time.

Thus the sage is sharp but not cutting,
pointed but not piercing,
straightforward but not overextended,
bright but not blinding.


Verse 59
In ruling people and serving Heaven,
nothing surpasses austerity.
Austerity means planning ahead.
Planning ahead means accumulating virtue.
Accumulating virtue means overcoming everything.
Overcoming everything means knowing no limits.
Knowing no limits means ruling the kingdom.
Ruling the kingdom means living long.
This means deep roots and a thick trunk,
the Way of long and lasting life.


Verse 60
Ruling a great kingdom
is like cooking a small fish.

When you govern the world with the Tao,
spirits display no powers.
Not that they have no power,
but their powers do people no harm.
Not that their powers can do people no harm,
but the sage protects them.

Neither harms the other,
so both accumulate virtue.


Verse 61
A great state is like a river basin.
The confluence of the world,
embodying the female.

The female overcomes the male through stillness.
In order to be still,
she needs to lower herself.

Thus the great state that lowers itself
rules the small state.
The small state that lowers itself
is ruled by the great state.
Some lower themselves to rule.
Some lower themselves to be ruled.

The great state's only desire
is to unite and lead others.
The small state's only desire
is to join and serve others.
For both to achieve their desire,
the greater must be lower.


Verse 62
The Tao is the source of the ten thousand things.
The treasure of the good
The refuge of the bad.

Beautiful words can be traded.
Noble deeds can be gifted.
How can we abandon people who are bad?
Thus when emperors are enthroned
or three ministers installed,
though there be great discs of jade
followed by teams of horses,
they don't rival one who sits
and offers up the Tao.

Why did the ancients treasure it?
Did they not say:
"Who seeks shall thereby find;
who errs shall thereby be forgiven"?
Thus the world treasures it.


Verse 63
Act without acting.
Work without working.
Taste without tasting.
The great are small.
The many are few.
Repay each wrong with virtue.

Plan for the hard while it's easy.
Work on the great while it's small.
The hardest task in the world begins easy.
The greatest goal in the world begins small.
Thus the sage never acts great.
He thus achieves great things.

One who promises often is seldom trusted.
One who makes things easy will encounter much hardship.
Therefore the sage makes everything hard.
He thus finds nothing hard.


Verse 64
It's easy to rule while it's peaceful.
It's easy to prevent before it's trouble.
It's easy to break while it's fragile.
It's easy to disperse while it's small.

Act before it exists.
Rule before it rebels.

A great tree grows from the tiniest shoot.
A giant tower rises from a basket of dirt.
A thousand-mile journey begins at your feet.

To act is to fail.
To control is to lose.
Therefore the sage doesn't act,
thus he doesn't fail.
He doesn't control,
thus he doesn't lose.

In pursuing a task,
people usually fail near the end.
Caring at the end as at the start
puts an end to failure.

Thus the sage desires no desire.
He doesn't prize what's hard to obtain.
He learns to not learn.
He attends to what others pass by.
To help the ten thousand things find their nature,
he thus dares not to act.


Verse 65
The ancient masters of the Way
did not use it to enlighten
but to keep people in the dark.
What makes people hard to rule
is that they have too much knowledge.
One who rules with knowledge
spreads evil in the realm.
One who rules without knowledge
spreads virtue in the realm.
One who understands these two
understands the universal key.
This is called Dark Virtue.
Dark Virtue goes deep,
goes far,
goes the other way,
until it reaches perfect harmony.


Verse 66
The sea can rule a hundred rivers
because it lies below them.

Thus if the sage would be above the people,
he should speak as if he were below them.
If he would stand in front of them,
he should act as if he were behind them.
Thus when the sage is above,
the people are not oppressed.
When he is in front,
the people are not hindered.
The world will support and encourage him without wearying.

Because he doesn't contend,
no one can contend with him.


Verse 67
The world calls me great.
Great but useless.
Because I am great I am useless.
If I were of use,
I would have stayed small.

But I possess three treasures
that I guard and cherish.
The first is compassion.
The second is austerity.
The third is reluctance to excel.

Because I am compassionate,
I can be valiant.
Because I am austere,
I can be extravagant.
Because I am reluctant to excel,
I can be supreme.

If I renounced compassion for valor,
austerity for extravagance,
reluctance for supremacy,
I would die.

Compassion wins every battle
and outlasts every attack.
What Heaven creates,
compassion protects.


Verse 68
In ancient times:
The perfect officer wasn't armed.
The perfect warrior wasn't angry.
The perfect conqueror wasn't hostile.
The perfect commander was humble.

This is called the virtue of not contending.
This is called using the strength of others.
This is called uniting with Heaven,
which was the ancient goal.


Verse 69
In warfare there is a saying:
Rather than a host,
better to be a guest.
Rather than advance an inch,
better to retreat a foot.

This means forming no column,
wearing no armor,
brandishing no weapon,
repulsing no enemy.

No fate is worse than to make light of an enemy.
Making light of an enemy means losing a treasure.
Thus when opponents are evenly matched,
the remorseful one prevails.


Verse 70
My words are easy to understand,
easy to employ.
But since no one can understand them,
no one can employ them.

Words have an ancestor.
Deeds have an ancestor.

Because they have no understanding,
people fail to understand me.
Rare are they who understand me.
Thus I am exalted.

Therefore the sage wears coarse cloth
and keeps his jade inside.


Verse 71
To realize that you do not understand
is transcendence.
Not to realize that you do not understand
is an affliction.
The reason the sage is not afflicted
is because he treats affliction as affliction.
Hence he is not afflicted.


Verse 72
When people no longer fear power,
a greater power will appear.

Don't restrict where people dwell.
Don't repress how people live.
If they aren't oppressed,
they won't protest.

Thus the sage knows himself
but doesn't reveal himself.
He loves himself
but doesn't exalt himself.
Thus he picks this over that.


Verse 73
Daring to act means death.
Daring not to act means life.
Of these two,
one benefits,
one harms.

Who knows the reason
for Heaven's dislikes?
The Way of Heaven
wins easily without a fight,
answers wisely without a word,
comes quickly without a summons,
plans ingeniously without a thought.

The Net of Heaven is all-embracing.
Its mesh is wide but nothing escapes.


Verse 74
If people no longer fear death,
why do we threaten to kill them?

And if others fear death,
and still act perverse,
and we catch and kill them,
who else will dare?

As long as people fear death,
the executioner will exist.
To kill in the executioner's place
is to take the carpenter's place.
Who takes the carpenter's place
is bound to hurt his hands.


Verse 75
The reason people are hungry
is because those above levy so many taxes.
Thus the people are hungry.

The reason people are hard to rule
is because those above are so forceful.
Thus the people are hard to rule.

The reason people think little of death
is because those above think so much of life.
Thus the people think little of death.

Meanwhile those who do not pursue life
are more esteemed than those who love life.


Verse 76
When people are born,
they are soft and supple.
When they perish,
they are hard and stiff.
When plants shoot forth,
they are soft and tender.
When they die,
they are withered and dry.

Thus it is said:
The hard and strong are followers of death.
The soft and weak are followers of life.

When an army becomes strong it suffers defeat.
When a plant becomes hard it snaps.

The hard and the strong dwell below.
The soft and the weak dwell above.


Verse 77
The Way of Heaven
is like stringing a bow.
Pulling down the high,
lifting up the low.
Shortening the long,
lengthening the short.

The Way of Heaven
takes from the long
and supplements the short.
Unlike the way of man,
taking from the short
and giving to the long.

Who can find the long
and give it to the world?
Only those who find the Way.

Thus the sage
acts without expecting,
achieves without claiming.
Thus he chooses to hide his skill.


Verse 78
Nothing in the world is weaker than water.
But against the hard and the strong,
nothing can beat it,
for nothing can change it.

The soft overcomes the hard.
The weak overcomes the strong.

This is something everyone knows,
but no one is able to practice.

Thus the sage declares:
One who accepts a country's disgrace
we call the lord of soil and grain.
One who accepts a country's misfortune
we call the king of all under Heaven.
Upright words sound upside down.


Verse 79
In resolving a great dispute,
some resentment is bound to remain.
How can this be good?

Thus the sage honors his word
and makes no claim on others.
Thus the virtuous mind what they owe
and the virtueless mind what they deserve.

The Way of Heaven is impartial,
but always helps the good.


Verse 80
Imagine a small state with few people.
Let there be labor-saving tools,
but no need to use them.
Let people consider death,
but not travel far.
Let there be boats and carts,
but no reason to ride them.
Let there be armor and weapons,
but no reason to employ them.

Let people return to tying knots to keep records.
Satisfied with their food,
pleased with their clothing,
content with their homes,
and happy with their customs.

Let there be a state so near,
people can hear its dogs and chickens,
but live out their lives
without ever paying a visit.


Verse 81
True words aren't beautiful.
Beautiful words aren't true.
The good aren't eloquent.
The eloquent aren't good.
The wise aren't learned.
The learned aren't wise.

The sage accumulates nothing,
but the more he does for others,
the greater his existence.
The more he gives to others,
the greater his abundance.

The Way of Heaven
is to help without harming.
The Way of the Sage
is to act without contending.
