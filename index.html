      "The way that becomes a way\nis not the Immortal Way.\nThe name that becomes a name\nis not the Immortal Name.\n\nThe nameless is the beginning of Heaven and Earth.\nThe named is the mother of the ten thousand things.\n\nDesireless, one sees the mystery.\nDesiring, one sees the manifestations.\n\nTwo different names\nfor the same source.\n\nThe one we call Dark\nThe Dark beyond Dark\nThe door to all beginnings.",
      "If that becomes beautiful\nthis becomes ugly.\nIf that becomes good\nthis becomes evil.\n\nHaving produces not having\nHard creates easy\nLong defines short\nHigh requires low\nNote contrasts noise\nAfter follows before.\n\nThus the sage acts without effort\nand teaches without words.\n\nThe ten thousand things arise endlessly.\nHe doesn't start the things he begins.\nHe doesn't presume when he acts.\nHe doesn't claim what he achieves.\nAnd because he makes no claim\nhe suffers no loss.",
      "Bestowing no honors\nkeeps people from fighting.\nPrizing no treasures\nkeeps people from stealing.\nDisplaying no temptation\nkeeps people from acting up.\n\nThe sage rules by emptying the mind and filling the stomach\nWeakening the will and strengthening the bones.\n\nBy keeping the people from knowing or wanting\nand keeping the people who know from acting\nhe thus rules them all.",
      "The Tao is empty.\nUsed, but never exhausted.\nBottomless, like the ancestor of us all.\n\nDulling our edges\nUntying our knots\nSoftening our light\nJoining our dust.\n\nSo deep, yet ever present.\nI wonder whose child it is.\nIt is older than God.",
      "Heaven and Earth are impartial,\ntreating the ten thousand things like straw dogs.\nImpartial is the sage,\ntreating people like straw dogs.\n\nBetween Heaven and Earth\nis a space like a bellows.\nEmpty yet inexhaustible,\neach movement produces more.\nTalking only wastes it.\nKeep it inside.",
      "The Valley Spirit that doesn't die\nwe call the Dark Womb.\nThe Dark Womb's mouth\nwe call the source of creation.\n\nIt is like a veil, barely seen.\nAnd yet we can't exhaust it.",
      "Heaven is eternal and Earth is immortal.\nThe reason they're eternal and immortal\nis because they don't live for themselves.\nHence they can live forever.\n\nThe sage stays back\nbut ends up in front.\nHe lets himself go\nbut ends up safely held.\nSelflessness must be the reason\nthat whatever he seeks he finds.",
      "The best are like water.\nNurturing the ten thousand things without trying to\nFlowing in places that others avoid\nAnd so they are like the Tao.\n\nDwelling with earth\nCultivating with depth\nRelating with kindness\nSpeaking with truth\nRuling with peace\nWorking with skill\nActing with awareness.\n\nAnd because they don't contend\nthey are free of blame.",
      "Instead of pouring in more,\nbetter to stop short.\nSharpen the blade\nand it won't last long.\nHouses full of treasure\ncan never be safe.\nThe vanity of success\ninvites its own failure.\n\nRetire when your work is done.\nThat is the Way of Heaven.",
      "Can you hold fast your crescent soul and not let it wander?\n\nCan you make your breath as soft as a baby's?\n\nCan you wipe your Dark Mirror free of dust?\n\nCan you serve and rule without effort?\n\nCan you become the female,\nopening and closing Heaven's Gate?\n\nCan you open to everything,\nunderstanding without knowing?\n\nGive birth and nurture.\nCreate without possessing.\nAct without expecting.\nRule without controlling.\nThis is called Dark Virtue.",
      "Thirty spokes converge at the hub,\nbut it's the center hole that makes the wheel turn.\n\nClay is shaped to make a pot,\nbut it's the space inside that makes it useful.\n\nWindows and doors are carved for a room,\nbut it's the holes that make a house livable.\n\nExistence makes it possible,\nbut nonexistence makes it work.",
      "The five colors blind the eye.\nThe five tones deafen the ear.\nThe five flavors numb the tongue.\nRiding and hunting disturb the mind.\nPrecious things lead us to wrongdoing.\n\nThus the sage puts the stomach ahead of the eyes.\nThus he picks this over that.",
      "Favor and disgrace are like warnings.\nHonor and disaster are like the body.\n\nWhy are favor and disgrace like warnings?\nTo seek favor is to stand beneath.\nTo gain it is like a warning.\nTo lose it is like a warning.\nThus are favor and disgrace like warnings.\n\nWhy are honor and disaster like the body?\nThe reason we have disaster\nis because we have a body.\nIf we didn't have a body\nwe wouldn't have disaster.\n\nOne who loves himself without seeking favor\ncan be entrusted with the world.\nOne who loves his body without fearing disaster\ncan truly care for the world.",
      "We look but don't see it\nand call it invisible.\nWe listen but don't hear it\nand call it inaudible.\nWe reach but don't grasp it\nand call it intangible.\nThree failed means to knowledge\nI weave into one.\n\nNot lit from above,\ncasting no shade below.\nToo fine to be named,\nit returns to nothing.\nThis is the formless form,\nthe immaterial image.\nIt is indefinable.\n\nMeeting it, you cannot see its face.\nFollowing it, you cannot see its back.\nHold to the ancient Way\nto rule this very realm\nand discover what has always been true.\n\nThis is the essence of the Tao.",
      "The ancient masters sought the unfathomable\nand penetrated the dark.\nBecause they cannot be known,\nI describe them with reluctance.\n\nThey were careful as if crossing a river in winter\nCautious as if danger were nearby\nReserved like a visiting guest\nYielding like melting ice\nSimple like uncarved wood\nOpen like a valley\nMurky like a puddle.\n\nBut a puddle becomes clear when it's still.\nAnd out of stillness, life is roused.\n\nThose who treasure this Way\ndon't seek fulfillment.\nNot seeking fulfillment,\nthey reside in the dark.",
      "Let everything be empty,\nand the center be still.\nThe ten thousand things rise and fall,\nand we watch them return.\nThey grow and flourish,\nreturning to the source.\n\nReturning to the source is stillness.\nTo be still is to revive.\nTo revive is to endure.\n\nKnowing this cycle is wisdom.\nNot knowing is to suffer in vain.\n\nKnowing how to endure is to be all-embracing.\nAll-embracing means impartial.\nImpartiality leads to nobility.\nNobility leads to Heaven.\nHeaven leads to the Tao.\n\nBeing at one with the Tao means long life.\nLife without trouble.",
      "The greatest rulers are barely known.\nThe next best are loved and revered.\nThen come those who are feared and respected.\nAnd finally, those who are despised.\n\nOne who does not trust others\nwill not be trusted.\n\nHesitate and guard your words.\nWhen their work succeeds,\npeople will think they did it.",
      "When the great Tao is forgotten,\ngoodness and justice appear.\nWhen reason appears,\nthe great pretense begins.\n\nWhen kinship falls into discord,\nfilial piety and devotion arise.\nWhen the country is in chaos,\nloyal officials appear.",
      "Get rid of holiness and wisdom\nand people will live a hundred times better.\nGet rid of kindness and justice\nand people recover piety and devotion.\nGet rid of cleverness and profit\nand thieves will cease to exist.\n\nBut these three sayings are not enough.\nHence let this be added:\nWear the undyed and hold the uncarved.\nAbolish self-interest and cast off desire.\nGet rid of learning and problems will vanish.",
      "Yes and no\naren't so far apart.\nBeautiful and ugly\naren't so unalike.\nWhat others fear\nwe too must fear.\nWhat nonsense!\n\nPeople joyfully feast\nas if they were at the Great Sacrifice,\nor climbing a tower\nto look from the terrace in spring.\n\nI sit here and make no sign,\nlike a baby that doesn't smile,\nlost with no one to turn to.\n\nOthers have plenty,\nI alone have nothing.\nMy mind is so foolish,\nso simple.\nOthers are clear and bright,\nI alone am dim.\nOthers are sharp and clever,\nI alone am confused.\n\nI drift like the waves of the sea,\nblowing aimlessly like the wind.\n\nEveryone has a purpose.\nI alone am directionless and dumb.\nFor I alone choose to differ.\nI drink from the Great Mother's breast.",
      "The expression of deepest virtue\ncomes from the Tao alone.\n\nThe Tao in action\nwaxes and wanes.\nIt waxes and wanes\nbut inside is an image.\nIt wanes and waxes\nbut inside is a form.\nIt's deep and dark\nbut inside is an essence.\nAn essence that is true and real\nand inside that lies faith.\n\nFrom the very beginning until now\nits name has never changed.\nSo we might follow our fathers.\n\nHow do we know what our fathers were like?\nThrough this.",
      "Partial means whole.\nCrooked means straight.\nHollow means full.\nWorn-out means new.\nLess means content.\nMore means confused.\nThus the sage holds onto the One\nto use in guiding the world.\n\nNot watching himself,\nhe appears.\nNot displaying himself,\nhe flourishes.\nNot flattering himself,\nhe succeeds.\nNot parading himself,\nhe leads.\nBecause he doesn't compete,\nno one can compete against him.\n\nThe ancients who said partial means whole\ncame close indeed.\nBecoming whole depends on this.",
      "To talk little is natural.\nA gale doesn't last all morning.\nA squall doesn't last all day.\nWho else could make these?\nOnly Heaven and Earth.\nIf Heaven and Earth can't make things last,\nwhat about man?\n\nThus in whatever you do,\nlet those on the Way be one with the Way.\nLet those who succeed be one with success.\nLet those who fail be one with failure.\n\nBe one with success,\nfor the Way succeeds too.\nBe one with failure,\nfor the Way fails too.",

      "In warfare there is a saying:\nRather than a host,\nbetter to be a guest.\nRather than advance an inch,\nbetter to retreat a foot.\n\nThis means forming no column,\nwearing no armor,\nbrandishing no weapon,\nrepulsing no enemy.\n\nNo fate is worse than to make light of an enemy.\nMaking light of an enemy means losing a treasure.\nThus when opponents are evenly matched,\nthe remorseful one prevails.",
      "My words are easy to understand,\neasy to employ.\nBut since no one can understand them,\nno one can employ them.\n\nWords have an ancestor.\nDeeds have an ancestor.\n\nBecause they have no understanding,\npeople fail to understand me.\nRare are they who understand me.\nThus I am exalted.\n\nTherefore the sage wears coarse cloth\nand keeps his jade inside.",
      "To realize that you do not understand\nis transcendence.\nNot to realize that you do not understand\nis an affliction.\nThe reason the sage is not afflicted\nis because he treats affliction as affliction.\nHence he is not afflicted.",
